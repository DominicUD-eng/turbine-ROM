- Start with disc and discreet points along a 1D line.
    - Input is going to be a Velocity Vector (tangential and Radial)
    - Output is going to have a desired pressure
    - Class for Node
        - Initial Node is outside
        - Initial velocity of first node is fixed
        - Exit pressure of last node is fixed
        - Navier Stokes equation -> Pousiele Flow Equation (These are the equations based on the nodes)
            - Start with steady state, non compressible fluid
    - Class for Mesh (Combo of Nodes)
        - Should establish even spacing of nodes
        - Treat as a global array
    - Class for Solver (Pass it the nodes)
        - Define Input and Output radius
            - 6in outer radius
            - 2in radius
        - Velocity
        - Kinetic Energy of disc
            - End goal is Toque
- Going to need a linear system solved (Implicit and Explicit, Idk which one to use)
    - Try to use solve IVP, if that doesn’t work go implicit, if that doesn’t work

-NEXT STEPS 9/8/2025
    01. Driver: argparse + CSV export (no physics changes).
ADDED    02. Solver: add outer loop with residuals and under-relaxation; still inviscid L.
ADDED    03. θ-momentum viscous decay: implement 2a, iterate to convergence.
ADDED    04. Radial viscous loss in dp/dr: add 2b and re-tune relaxation.
    05. Diagnostics: dimensionless numbers + plots.
    06. Boundary modes: mass-flow BC and pressure-at-outer option.
    07. Tests + grid-independence harness.


Notes for Meeting 9/9
    NOT USEFULL IF I DON"T KNOW HOW IT WORKS

    When change to compressible
        -mmdot will remain the same
        -vdot will increase

    TimeStamp loop
        Convergence loop   
            r Spatial loop
                Solve Individual node
            is convergence true?

    largely solving for vtheta and Vr
    Llinear Solver to start not, parabolic

    Disk Property Class
    Outlet Pressure 0 as a gauge pressure
    5/ms initial velocity
    dumb it down -> Nodes, Build Mesh, Solve
    simple cfd algorithm steady state GOOGLE IMAGE First three STEPS
    Plot each V at Node
    When disk stops slowing down, stop the sim
    increase convergence to 1000? Or time delay
    whatch a simple CFD alg video
    
CURRENT STANCE:
 - using solve_ivp and rhs to solve navier stokes and Jacobi sweeps to check for convergence
 - Pressure is DERIVED, not coupled with velocity for now. I think thats the next step 
 - The equation for pressure is dp/dr = rho*(vt^2/r) - rho*vr*(dvr/dr)
        - centrifugal force - radial acceleration (decelerating as moves inward)


10/8/2025
- convergence will be checked OUTSIDE of node 
- BC will be set for the outermost node, Node[0]
- I want solver to spiral inwards for my own sanity for some reason idk 
- rediscuss inverse matrix solution (take notes) and explicit sovler
