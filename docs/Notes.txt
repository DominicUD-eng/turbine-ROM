- Start with disc and discreet points along a 1D line.
    - Input is going to be a Velocity Vector (tangential and Radial)
    - Output is going to have a desired pressure
    - Class for Node
        - Initial Node is outside
        - Initial velocity of first node is fixed
        - Exit pressure of last node is fixed
        - Navier Stokes equation -> Pousiele Flow Equation (These are the equations based on the nodes)
            - Start with steady state, non compressible fluid
    - Class for Mesh (Combo of Nodes)
        - Should establish even spacing of nodes
        - Treat as a global array
    - Class for Solver (Pass it the nodes)
        - Define Input and Output radius
            - 6in outer radius
            - 2in radius
        - Velocity
        - Kinetic Energy of disc
            - End goal is Toque
- Going to need a linear system solved (Implicit and Explicit, Idk which one to use)
    - Try to use solve IVP, if that doesn’t work go implicit, if that doesn’t work
